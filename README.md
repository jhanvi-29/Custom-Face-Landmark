# Custom Face Landmark Detection

This repository contains code and resources for detecting custom facial landmarks using deep learning models. Using this we can successfully implement any facial filters like snapchat, can assist in driver monitoring bt pupil tracking and much more.

## Contents

- `81FaceLandmark_Dynamic_ModelCode.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the dynamic model code of 81 facial landmarks.
- `81croplandmarks.csv`: CSV file containing cropped landmarks data.
- `CropModel_81points-CNN.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the CNN model to detect 81 facial landmarks.
- `CustomFaceLandmarkDetection.docx`: Documentation detailing the custom face landmark detection process.
- `FaceLandmark_Dynamic_ModelCode.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the dynamic model code.
- `LandmarktoCSV.py`: Python script to convert landmarks data to CSV format.
- `datagenerate-81Landmarks.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for generating data for 81 landmarks.
- `facelandmark_inference.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for inference using the face landmark detection model.
- `output.jpg`: Sample output image.
